# cs300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Identifying and implementing a data structure that would minimize the overall time complexity for reading, storing, and searching specific data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I started by by examining the results of the runtime analysis performed in the first project, and then used that information along with my estimation of how frequently each component of the program would need to execute.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I revisited course materials, consulted documentation, and researched similar problems to arrive at solutions.  I then iteratively tested my solution, using both small-scale examples and edge cases to identify and resolve issues.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Expanding my familiarity with different data structures and sorting algorithms will inform decisions in the future about optimal approaches to storing and manipulating data.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

As the implementation for each data structure became more complex, my appreciation for modular and adaptable solutions increased.  The experience has prepared me to tackle more complex problems in the future, with a focus on creating solutions that are efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.
